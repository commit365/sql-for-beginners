### Lesson 27: Capstone Project

#### Designing and Implementing a Database Project
The capstone project is an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills you have acquired throughout your SQL lessons. It involves designing and implementing a database project that addresses a real-world problem or scenario. Here are the steps to guide you through the process:

1. **Define the Project Scope**:
   - Identify the purpose of the database. What problem will it solve? Who are the intended users?
   - Example: A database for managing a small bookstore's inventory, sales, and customer information.

2. **Gather Requirements**:
   - Collect requirements from stakeholders (if applicable) to understand their needs and expectations.
   - Determine what data needs to be stored, how it will be used, and what reports or queries will be necessary.

3. **Design the Database Schema**:
   - Create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the entities (tables), attributes (columns), and relationships (foreign keys) in your database.
   - Define primary keys for each table and establish relationships between tables (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).

4. **Implement the Database**:
   - Use SQL to create the database and its tables based on your design.
   - Insert sample data to test the functionality of your database.
   
   **Example SQL Commands**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE books (
       book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       title VARCHAR(100),
       author VARCHAR(100),
       price DECIMAL(10, 2),
       stock INT
   );

   CREATE TABLE customers (
       customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(50),
       email VARCHAR(100)
   );

   CREATE TABLE sales (
       sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       book_id INT,
       customer_id INT,
       sale_date DATE,
       quantity INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(book_id),
       FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
   );
   ```

5. **Develop Queries and Reports**:
   - Write SQL queries to perform common operations such as retrieving data, updating records, and generating reports.
   - Example: A query to find total sales for each book.
   ```sql
   SELECT b.title, SUM(s.quantity) AS total_sold
   FROM sales s
   JOIN books b ON s.book_id = b.book_id
   GROUP BY b.title;
   ```

#### Presenting Your Project
Once your database project is complete, it's time to present your work. This is an opportunity to showcase your design, implementation, and the insights derived from your database. Here are some tips for an effective presentation:

1. **Prepare Your Presentation**:
   - Create a slide deck that outlines the project scope, design choices, and key features of your database.
   - Include visuals such as your ERD, sample queries, and any reports generated from the database.

2. **Demonstrate Functionality**:
   - Live demonstrations can be very effective. Show how to navigate your database, run queries, and generate reports.
   - Highlight any unique features or challenges you overcame during the project.

3. **Engage Your Audience**:
   - Encourage questions and discussions. Be prepared to explain your design decisions and how they address the project requirements.

#### Peer Review and Feedback
Peer review is an essential part of the learning process, allowing you to gain insights from others and improve your project based on constructive feedback. Here’s how to conduct a peer review:

1. **Review Each Other’s Projects**:
   - Exchange projects with a peer and evaluate their database design, implementation, and functionality.
   - Use a checklist to assess key aspects such as data integrity, normalization, usability, and query performance.

2. **Provide Constructive Feedback**:
   - Offer specific suggestions for improvement, highlighting both strengths and areas for enhancement.
   - Be respectful and supportive, focusing on how the project can be improved rather than personal preferences.

3. **Incorporate Feedback**:
   - After receiving feedback, take the time to reflect on the suggestions and make necessary adjustments to your project.
   - This iterative process can lead to a more robust and effective database solution.

### Summary
The capstone project is a culmination of your learning experience, allowing you to apply SQL skills in a practical context. By designing and implementing a database project, presenting your work, and engaging in peer review, you enhance your understanding of database concepts and gain valuable experience that will serve you well in real-world applications. This project not only solidifies your knowledge but also prepares you for future challenges in database management and data analysis.

### Lesson 2: Introduction to MySQL

#### What is MySQL?
MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that utilizes Structured Query Language (SQL) for accessing and managing data. It is known for its reliability, performance, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for both small and large applications. MySQL stores data in tables, which can be modified and queried using SQL commands, allowing for efficient data organization and retrieval. Key features of MySQL include:

- **Open Source**: MySQL is free to use and can be modified to suit user needs.
- **Cross-Platform**: It runs on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **High Performance**: MySQL can handle a large number of queries and transactions efficiently.
- **Security**: It provides robust security features, including data encryption and user authentication.
- **Community Support**: MySQL has a large community of users and extensive documentation available online.

#### Installing MySQL and MySQL Workbench
To get started with MySQL, you need to install both the MySQL server and MySQL Workbench. Here’s a step-by-step guide for installation:

1. **Download MySQL**:

   - Choose the appropriate version for your operating system and download the installer.

2. **Install MySQL Server**:
   - Run the installer and follow the prompts to install the MySQL server.
   - During installation, you will be prompted to configure the server, including setting the root password and selecting the default authentication method.

3. **Install MySQL Workbench**:
   - MySQL Workbench is a graphical interface for managing MySQL databases. It can be installed alongside the MySQL server.
   - In the installer, select MySQL Workbench under the applications section and proceed with the installation.

4. **Start MySQL Server**:
   - After installation, ensure that the MySQL server is running. You can check its status using the command:
     ```
     sudo service mysql status
     ```
   - If it’s not running, you can start it with:
     ```
     sudo service mysql start
     ```

5. **Connect to MySQL Workbench**:
   - Open MySQL Workbench and create a new connection using the local instance of the MySQL server.
   - Enter the root password you set during installation to access the database.

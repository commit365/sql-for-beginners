### Lesson 1: What is SQL?

#### Definition and Purpose of SQL
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to perform various operations on the data stored in databases, including:

- **Querying Data**: Retrieving specific information from one or more tables.
- **Inserting Data**: Adding new records to tables.
- **Updating Data**: Modifying existing records.
- **Deleting Data**: Removing records from tables.
- **Database Management**: Creating and modifying database structures, such as tables and relationships.

The primary purpose of SQL is to enable users to interact with databases in a straightforward and efficient manner, making it an essential skill for data analysts, developers, and anyone working with data.

#### Overview of Relational Databases
Relational databases are a type of database that organizes data into structured tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity (e.g., customers, orders, products), and the relationships between these entities are defined through keys. Key concepts include:

- **Tables**: The fundamental building blocks of a relational database, where data is stored in rows and columns.
- **Rows**: Each row (or record) in a table represents a single instance of the entity (e.g., one customer).
- **Columns**: Each column represents a specific attribute of the entity (e.g., customer name, email address).
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each record in a table, ensuring that no two rows have the same value for this column.
- **Foreign Key**: A field in one table that links to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.

Relational databases use SQL to perform operations on the data, making it easier to maintain data integrity and enforce relationships. Popular relational database management systems (RDBMS) include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
